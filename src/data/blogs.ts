On June 5, 2025, I had the incredible honor of being invited to attend the landmark launch of **OpenAI Academy: Future Skills for India** — hosted at The Oberoi, New Delhi, in collaboration with IndiaAI Future Skills Mission and the Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology (MeitY).

This event wasn’t just about tech — it was about **inclusion, vision, and responsibility** in AI.

✨ **Key Moments That Made It Unforgettable**:

🎤 **Alex Nawar** (Head, OpenAI Academy) shared how **India is the second-largest user of ChatGPT globally** and how the new Academy will democratize AI literacy with localized content and hands-on training.

💬 **Lauren Oliphant** (Solutions Engineer, OpenAI) gave jaw-dropping live demos:
- ChatGPT conversing in Hindi & English
- Generating Hindi *dohaas*
- Visualizing real-time web data
- Use cases in yoga, education, art, and even as a personal employee assistant.

🧠 **Jason K.** (Chief Strategy Officer, OpenAI) reminded us that **India isn’t just a user base — it’s a global AI catalyst**. His words: *“This is just the beginning.”* resonated deeply.

💡 **Abhishek Singh**, DG (NIC) & AS at MeitY, emphasized **regional learning, prompt engineering**, and the power of **OpenAI’s APIs** to transform sectors like agri-tech, education, and governance.

👥 The **panel discussion** was pure inspiration:
- **Azeez Gupta** (Rocket Learning)
- **Amrita Mahale** (ARMMAN)
- **Nidhi Bhasin** (Digital Green Trust)
- **Anubhav Arora** (Noora Health)

Their real-world AI impact — from **rural education** to **public health** — proved one thing: **AI is not just about algorithms; it’s about people**. 💛

🎉 And yes — **finally meeting Ansh Mehra** in person was a huge highlight for me. Humble, brilliant, and a powerhouse of design + AI wisdom. 🙌

Gratitude to **OpenAI, IndiaAI, MeitY, and all the minds behind the mission** for crafting such an immersive and action-driven event. This wasn’t about the future of AI — it was about **building** that future, here and now.

Let’s collaborate, innovate, and grow — for **India and beyond**. 🌐
