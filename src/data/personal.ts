  bio: `I'm Brajesh Kumar, a passionate and adaptable Computer Science and Engineering student at GL Bajaj Group of Institutions (Batch 2023–2027). With a strong foundation in full-stack development, machine learning, and AI-based systems, I thrive on building real-world tech solutions that are not only innovative but impactful.

I bring a hands-on approach to problem-solving, demonstrated through my wide array of projects ranging from intelligent personal assistants like Emma, AI-powered therapy bots like Thea, to full-fledged web platforms like SEMAC and IdeaPool. I've also contributed to game development and ed-tech innovations, combining creativity with code.

My toolkit includes a wide stack of technologies: MERN, Python, Django, Flutter, React Native, TensorFlow, GANs, and cloud tools like AWS. I'm constantly learning, experimenting, and pushing boundaries.

I've interned with over 10 companies, gaining real-world exposure in Python development, web design, and AI systems. I hold over 100+ certifications from platforms like IBM, Coursera, Forage, Google Cloud, Cisco, and more, and I actively participate in hackathons, CTFs, and coding contests (3★ CodeChef, 5★ HackerRank in Python).

Beyond code, I'm a team player, quick learner, and a creative thinker — always excited to collaborate and bring new ideas to life.`
